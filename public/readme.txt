This is a readme file for CMPT276 Assignment 2.

This application is divided into two parts: database and visualization.

Functions of the database include a form which can be saved into a table of student data, an edit button for entries already registered in the table and a remove button to delete a row of data from the table.

The visualization function consist of making rectangle representations of student data which displays the name and gpa of the student in text, a background color based on the "hair color" entry, and a font color that changes to white when the background color is too dark (black, indigo, and navy). The height of the rectangle directly represents the height of the student, and the width is derived by calculating the BMI index of the student via weight(km)/height(m)^2 (weight * 10000 / height / height), adjusting the width based on the categories of underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese.
